<p><span style="font-size: small;">I get letters now and again asking how people are able to create such great looking alert and prompt boxes, along with properly formatted text, including often used ascii characters. They also want to know how people get line breaks and double and single quotes to show up so nicely.</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-size: small;">This also translates to any JavaScript commands that write to the page, including the document.write command. I know you've hit this wall. You write a script and you'd like to put in a single quote as in the word "you'll" or "you're". YOU know it's just a single quote but the darn JavaScript thinks it's the end of the line. Ugh! When will they build a computer that can read our minds? Is that too much to ask?</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-size: small;">I guess it is. Until the mind-reading computers come out, using a single quote in a JavaScript line means one thing...Error!</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-size: small;">But fear not. Learn these few simple escape characters and you'll be well on your way to putting quotes, returns, and tabs all over the JavaScript place.</span></p>
